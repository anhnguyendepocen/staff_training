* Background

Here are [[file:anova_slides.pdf][slides for the presentation part]] of this session.

There are three ways to perform analysis of variance (ANOVA) in R.

1. =base::aov()=;
2. =car::Anova()=; and
3. =ez::ezANOVA()=.

(Note =xxx::yyy()= syntax means the function =yyy()= in package =xxx=; =base= is just base R, i.e., the function comes pre-installed with R so to use the function you don't have to load in any packages.)

If you have balanced data, the factors are uncorrelated (e.g. due to random assignment), and none of your within-subject factors has more that 2 levels, you can use =aov()=.

If your goal is to replicate the output from SPSS, then your best bet is to use =ez::ezANOVA()=, because it provides Greenhouse-Geiser correction in case you have more than three levels of a within-subject factor, and handles unbalanced data more easily.

If your goal is to learn a flexible way of analysis that can accommodate all different types of data, forget about ANOVA and learn about mixed-effects modeling.  Just to get this off my chest, here are four reasons why you don't really want to use ANOVA with psychological data:

1. Doesn't adequately handle more than one random factor at a time,
   and therefore, cannot properly generalize over both subjects and
   stimuli;
2. Dealing with unbalanced data can be complicated;
3. Requires that your dependent variable is continuous, and therefore
   is not ideal for discrete scale data or binary data;
4. Difficult to deal with continuous predictors.

* The ANT dataset

We will be using /simulated/ data from the Attention Network Test (ANT) by Fan et al. (2002), which is included as part of the =ez= package.

So, we have a mixed design with one between factor (=group=) and two within factors (=cue=, =flank=).  Both of our within-subject factors have more than two levels, so we're going to want to correct for possible violations of sphericity (Greenhouse-Geiser).  Just to make things more fun, the data are unbalanced now that we've thrown out trials with inaccurate responses.  So if we can handle these data, we can handle anything...

Before doing any analysis, let's look at the cell means.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ANT_means <- ANT_acc %>%
      group_by(group, cue, flank) %>%
      summarise(mRT = mean(rt)) %>% ungroup()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports results
  ANT_means %>% as.data.frame()
#+END_SRC

Plot them...

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file ant_means.png :width 600 :height 300
  ggplot(ANT_means, aes(flank, mRT, colour = cue)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = cue)) +
    geom_point(aes(shape = cue), size = 3) +
    facet_wrap(~group)
#+END_SRC

** Analysis using =ezANOVA()=

So what might we expect from this plot?  Main effects of flank and cue, maybe even a three-way interaction?

OK let's check out the =ez::ezANOVA()= documentation before running our function.

Compute ANOVA

Description:

     This function provides easy analysis of data from factorial
     experiments, including purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a. “repeated
     measures”), purely between-Ss designs, and mixed
     within-and-between-Ss designs, yielding ANOVA results, generalized
     effect sizes and assumption checks.

Usage:

     ezANOVA(
         data
         , dv
         , wid
         , within = NULL
         , within_full = NULL
         , within_covariates = NULL
         , between = NULL
         , between_covariates = NULL
         , observed = NULL
         , diff = NULL
         , reverse_diff = FALSE
         , type = 2
         , white.adjust = FALSE
         , detailed = FALSE
         , return_aov = FALSE
     )
     
Arguments:

    data: Data frame containing the data to be analyzed.

      dv: Name of the column in ‘data’ that contains the dependent
          variable. Values in this column must be numeric.

     wid: Name of the column in ‘data’ that contains the variable
          specifying the case/Ss identifier. This should be a unique
          value per case/Ss.

  within: Names of columns in ‘data’ that contain predictor variables
          that are manipulated (or observed) within-Ss. If a single
          value, may be specified by name alone; if multiple values,
          must be specified as a .() list.

within_full: Same as within, but intended to specify the full within-Ss
          design in cases where the data have not already been
          collapsed to means per condition specified by ‘within’ and
          when ‘within’ only specifies a subset of the full design.

within_covariates: Names of columns in ‘data’ that contain predictor
          variables that are manipulated (or observed) within-Ss and
          are to serve as covariates in the analysis. If a single
          value, may be specified by name alone; if multiple values,
          must be specified as a .() list.

 between: Names of columns in ‘data’ that contain predictor variables
          that are manipulated (or observed) between-Ss. If a single
          value, may be specified by name alone; if multiple values,
          must be specified as a .() list.

between_covariates: Names of columns in ‘data’ that contain predictor
          variables that are manipulated (or observed) between-Ss and
          are to serve as covariates in the analysis. If a single
          value, may be specified by name alone; if multiple values,
          must be specified as a .() list.

observed: Names of columns in ‘data’ that are already specified in
          either ‘within’ or ‘between’ that contain predictor variables
          that are observed variables (i.e. not manipulated). If a
          single value, may be specified by name alone; if multiple
          values, must be specified as a .() list. The presence of
          observed variables affects the computation of the generalized
          eta-squared measure of effect size reported by ‘ezANOVA’.

    diff: Names of any variables to collapse to a difference score. If
          a single value, may be specified by name alone; if multiple
          values, must be specified as a .() list. All supplied
          variables must be factors, ideally with only two levels
          (especially if setting the ‘reverse_diff’ argument to TRUE).

reverse_diff: Logical. If TRUE, triggers reversal of the difference
          collapse requested by ‘diff’. Take care with variables with
          more than 2 levels.

    type: Numeric value (either ‘1’, ‘2’ or ‘3’) specifying the Sums of
          Squares “type” to employ when data are unbalanced (eg. when
          group sizes differ). ‘type = 2’ is the default because this
          will yield identical ANOVA results as ‘type = 1’ when data
          are balanced but ‘type = 2’ will additionally yield various
          assumption tests where appropriate. When data are unbalanced,
          users are warned that they should give special consideration
          to the value of ‘type’. ‘type=3’ will emulate the approach
          taken by popular commercial statistics packages like SAS and
          SPSS, but users are warned that this approach is not without
          criticism.

white.adjust: Only affects behaviour if the design contains only
          between-Ss predictor variables. If not FALSE, the value is
          passed as the white.adjust argument to ‘Anova’, which
          provides heteroscedasticity correction. See ‘Anova’ for
          details on possible values.

detailed: Logical. If TRUE, returns extra information (sums of squares
          columns, intercept row, etc.) in the ANOVA table.

return_aov: Logical. If TRUE, computes and returns an aov object
          corresponding to the requested ANOVA (useful for computing
          post-hoc contrasts).

Details:

     ANCOVA is implemented by first regressing the DV against each
     covariate (after collapsing the data to the means of that
     covariate's levels per subject) and subtracting from the raw data
     the fitted values from this regression (then adding back the mean
     to maintain scale). These regressions are computed across Ss in
     the case of between-Ss covariates and computed within each Ss in
     the case of within-Ss covariates.

Value:

     A list containing one or more of the following components:

   ANOVA: A data frame containing the ANOVA results.

Mauchly's Test for Sphericity: If any within-Ss variables with >2
          levels are present, a data frame containing the results of
          Mauchly's test for Sphericity. Only reported for effects >2
          levels because sphericity necessarily holds for effects with
          only 2 levels.

Sphericity Corrections: If any within-Ss variables are present, a data
          frame containing the Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt
          epsilon values, and corresponding corrected p-values.

Levene's Test for Homogeneity: If the design is purely between-Ss, a
          data frame containing the results of Levene's test for
          Homogeneity of variance. Note that Huynh-Feldt corrected
          p-values where the Huynh-Feldt epsilon >1 will use 1 as the
          correction epsilon.

     aov: An aov object corresponding to the requested ANOVA.
     Some column names in the output data frames are abbreviated to
     conserve space:

       DFn         Degrees of Freedom in the numerator (a.k.a. DFeffect).                                                                
       DFd         Degrees of Freedom in the denominator (a.k.a. DFerror).                                                               
       SSn         Sum of Squares in the numerator (a.k.a. SSeffect).

       p           p-value (probability of the data given the null hypothesis).

Warning:

     Prior to running (though after obtaining running ANCOVA
     regressions as described in the ‘details’ section), ‘dv’ is
     collapsed to a mean for each cell defined by the combination of
     ‘wid’ and any variables supplied to ‘within’ and/or ‘between’
     and/or ‘diff’. Users are warned that while convenient when used
     properly, this automatic collapsing can lead to inconsistencies if
     the pre-collapsed data are unbalanced (with respect to cells in
     the full design) and only the partial design is supplied to
     ‘ezANOVA’. When this is the case, use ‘within_full’ to specify the
     full design to ensure proper automatic collapsing.

#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that we should be using Type III ss if we want to replicate SPSS output.

(Note that this is using RM-ANOVA and not mixed-model ANOVA; in the latter case you would have different error terms for the different effects.)

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  rt_anova <- ezANOVA(ANT_acc, rt, subnum, within = .(cue, flank),
                      between = group, type = 3)

  print(rt_anova)

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 Warning: Collapsing data to cell means. *IF* the requested effects are a subset of the full design, you must use the "within_full" argument, else results may be inaccurate.

** Compare to SPSS output

First we have to reshape the data from long to wide.  Better to do this in R using =tidyr::spread()= than to try to do this in SPSS!

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ANT_agg <- ANT_acc %>%
    group_by(subnum, group, cue, flank) %>%
    summarise(RT = mean(rt)) %>% ungroup()

  for_spss <- ANT_agg %>%
    mutate(cond = paste(cue, flank, sep = "_")) %>%
    select(subnum, group, cond, RT) %>%
    spread(cond, RT)

  write.csv(for_spss, "for_spss.csv", row.names = FALSE)
