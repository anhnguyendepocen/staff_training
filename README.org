* Staff training materials

These materials were created using emacs org-mode version 9.0.9 (emacs version 24.5.1).  The source files all have a =.org= extension, and can be used to compile using the =org-export-dispatch= command.  If you run the elisp code in =publish.el= and choose to publish the project ="org"= from the export dispatcher, it will create all of the html files.

The materials are provided with a CC-BY license.
